            occasionally.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside until cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180˚C.</li>
        <li>To make the cheese sauce, melt butter in a saucepan. Add flour and cook until frothy. Gradually add milk,
            stirring constantly until mixture boils and thickens.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid or plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
